Using extern is only of relevance when the program you're building consists of multiple source files linked together, where some of the variables defined, for example, in source file file1.c need to be referenced in other source files, such as file2.c.



It is important to understand the difference between defining a variable and declaring a variable:



A variable is declared when the compiler is informed that a variable exists (and this is its type); it does not allocate the storage for the variable at that point.



A variable is defined when the compiler allocates the storage for the variable.



You may declare a variable multiple times (though once is sufficient); you may only define it once within a given scope. A variable definition is also a declaration, but not all variable declarations are definitions.



Best way to declare and define global variables

The clean, reliable way to declare and define global variables is to use a header file to contain an extern declaration of the variable.



The header is included by the one source file that defines the variable and by all the source files that reference the variable. For each program, one source file (and only one source file) defines the variable. Similarly, one header file (and only one header file) should declare the variable. The header file is crucial; it enables cross-checking between independent TUs (translation units â€” think source files) and ensures consistency.



Although there are other ways of doing it, this method is simple and reliable. It is demonstrated by file3.h, file1.c and file2.c:
